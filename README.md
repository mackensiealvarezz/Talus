# Talus - IN PROGRESS


Talus is a laravel package that focuses on **creating APIS wrappers for websites that don't have any apis.** Yes, you read that right. 

You simply write YAML and Talus will convert it into an API for you.

# Why?

You ever have an idea and were unable to continue it because a website doesn't have an api ? This is the solution to that problem. This allows you to create APIs for websites that don't have any, with **0 lines of code**, just YAML.
